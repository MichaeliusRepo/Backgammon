# Backgammon in C# and MonoGame
This game was written in C# and ![MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/).

The solution contains to primary components: The game's model was made with test-driven development and implements Backgammon game rules and logic with unit-tests. The other component is the MonoGame project, providing visuals, audio and controls, and uses the model to enforce game rules.

An additional project also contains a simple example of local server play, where two game instances can play against each other.

Another project contains an attempt at developing a machine-learning framework for developing a Backgammon AI with reinforcement-learning, inspired by ![TD-Gammon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD-Gammon). Since the machine-learning framework did not produce the expected results, the AI's weights were hand-adjusted to create a simple Backgammon AI to play against.
